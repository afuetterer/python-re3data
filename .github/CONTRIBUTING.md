## Get Started!

Ready to contribute?

You need Python >= 3.10 and [hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch). You can install it globally with
[pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):

```console
$ pipx install hatch
```

or locally with (this will install it in the local virtual environment):

```console
$ python -m pip install hatch
```

Here's how to set up `python-re3data` for local development.

1. Fork the python-re3data repository on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally:

    ```console
    $ git clone git@github.com:username/python-re3data.git
    ```

3. Install your local copy into a virtual environment. Assuming you have hatch installed, this is how you set up your
    fork for local development:

    ```console
    $ cd python-re3data
    $ hatch shell
    ```

4. Create a branch for local development:

    ```console
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass pre-commit and the tests:

    ```console
    $ hatch run check
    $ hatch run cov
    ```

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    ```console
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a
    docstring.
3. The pull request should work for Python >= 3.10. Check <https://github.com/afuetterer/python-re3data/pulls> and make
    sure that all the tests pass.
